    "summary": "I am a passionate software developer since 1997. My strength is my allround knowledge from low-level operating systems and assembler up to Clojure and the Cloud. Coupled with a solid understanding of security topics and distributed systems, this allows me to design and analyse complex, networked architectures. In parallel, I am cooperating with stakeholders to distill their functional requirements without mixing technical decisions into it. My broad knowledge and toolset allows me to find simple solutions to functional requirements.",
